# Increase/Decrease value of a number

In normal mode, using Ctrl + a `<C-a>` and Ctrl + x `<C-x>` will increase or decrease value of a number.
This also let you jump to the nearest number as well.

Normally the number will be increased or decreased by 1. However a number can be specified,
for example `100<C-a>` will increase the number by 100.
